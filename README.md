# NoteApp
üì± Frontend (Android Application)
The frontend of the note-taking application was developed using Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, providing a modern, responsive, and highly intuitive user interface for creating, editing, and managing notes. To ensure scalability and maintainability, the app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which separates concerns and allows for cleaner state management. I also integrated Dependency Injection (Hilt/Dagger) to manage dependencies efficiently and improve testability. For offline functionality, I implemented the Room Database, which enables users to securely store and access notes locally, even without an internet connection. To handle cloud data synchronization and communication with the backend server, I used Retrofit for consuming REST APIs, ensuring smooth and efficient network operations. The combination of Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Room, Retrofit, and Dependency Injection made the application modular, testable, and robust, while also enhancing the overall user experience.

‚òÅÔ∏è Backend (Server-Side Application)
The backend was designed and developed using Spring Boot, providing a secure and reliable foundation for server-side operations. I implemented MongoDB as the primary cloud database, chosen for its scalability, flexibility in handling unstructured data, and efficient query capabilities, making it ideal for storing and managing notes across multiple users. The backend was deployed on Render server, ensuring reliable hosting, smooth deployment, and high availability for cloud-based operations. I built RESTful APIs that allowed seamless data exchange between the mobile app and the server, supporting functionalities such as note creation, updating, synchronization, and retrieval. With this setup, the application ensures that user notes are always synchronized between local storage and the cloud, providing a seamless offline-first experience while maintaining data integrity. This backend design demonstrates my expertise in server-side development, cloud integration, API design, and deployment pipelines, enabling a fully functional end-to-end note-taking solution.
