# NoteApp
I developed a feature-rich note-taking application that provides a seamless experience for creating, storing, and managing notes across devices. The front end of the application was built using Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, ensuring a modern, responsive, and intuitive user interface. For offline functionality, I integrated the Room Database, enabling users to store and access their notes locally even without an internet connection. On the backend, I designed and implemented a robust server using Spring Boot, with MongoDB as the primary cloud database to handle scalable storage and efficient data management. The backend was hosted on Render server, allowing smooth deployment and reliable accessibility for cloud-based operations. The app synchronizes data between the cloud and local storage, ensuring that user notes are always up-to-date while supporting offline-first usage. This project highlights my ability to work across the full stack, combining strong Android development skills with backend design, cloud integration, and deployment expertise to deliver a reliable and user-friendly application.
